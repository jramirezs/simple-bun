# simple-bun

I wanted to play with `bun`. It is Blazing Fastâ„¢.

Compared to [simple-node-typescript](https://github.com/jramirezs/simple-node-typescript) starter I use, it's also more simplified.

## Getting started

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

### Main commands

```bash
# Start server from build (production-like)
bun run start

# Start project with nodemon with hot-reloading
npm run dev

# Runs linter
npm run lint
```
